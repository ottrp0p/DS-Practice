# Introduction

This repo is to document  AY's Data Science practice starting Nov 2025. The overall structure will be using kaggle datasets to practice with. 


# Structure 

We will be borrowing kaggle data sets to do the following with: 

- praciticing speed of EDA, Experimentation Design, Implementation Analysis, Metric exploration
- self developing hypothetical product sense questions -- answering them by virtue of exploration and business sense. 
- potentially going the extra step for modelling, visualization, and other end product implementations for certain projects.
