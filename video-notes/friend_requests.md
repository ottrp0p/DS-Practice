# question
PM says Friend requests are down by 10%, what to do? 

# actual interview 

- rephrases it back 
- clarifying question 
    -  what counts as a friend requests. Is it sent? Requested? 
        - we clairfy to accepteds are down 
    - How do we calculate this metric? 
        - number of friend requests accepted are down 10% 


- plan 
    - talk about high level reasons that could do with this 
    - then break it down into components
    - segmentation 
    
- more clarifying 
    - sudden or gradual? 
        - if it was sudden 
            - expect data gathering/operational problems
        - if it was gradual 
            - we expect it to be some kind of actual operational change 
            - Have we changed anything to the calculations or definitions or criterias
            - Have we made any product level changes that affect the process 
                - but nothing obvious according to the interviewer 
        - what was the time frame? 
            - it was over a year 
                - concludes unlikely for data problem or operational 
            - seasonality? 
                - no 
            - any growth marketing campaign that we're coinciding with? 
                - No, but can you give ex? 
                    - If we had some kind of campaign that boosted the number, but eventually reverted to mean. 
        - any other metric in the ecosystem that we've seen changed? 
            - DAU, engagement time, any other KPI 

    - DAU * avg friend request / user = friend request rate / day 
        - let's say DAU is not going down
        - we are not isolated to avg friend request / user (by unit of time)

    - We now want to break down friend req/user into cohorts (at time of measurement) by maturity age. 
        - segmentation analysis 
            - gender/age not ok due to restrictions
            - tries to apply geography (???)
    
    - User Journey 
        - Could be sending fewer reqs 
        - could be reqs being dropped
        - could be notifications 


- feedback 
    - Clarified the metric: Good!
    - Looked at gradual vs sudden decline 
    - structured the answer into segmenetations -> conclusion 
    - Miss: # of friend requests sent vs accepted (fraud angle)
    - Miss: interviwers don't have a set root cause... on the interviewer to keep going and generate hypothesis and test for both sides
